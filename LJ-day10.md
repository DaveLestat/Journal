I have no clue to what exactly the DOM entails.  In theory it seems to be the overall collection of the various visible elements in a webpage.  While accessing it and editing it seems faily forward in class, I am already lost the moment we left the classroom.

This new Salmon Cookies seems quite daunting.  The js code for the project seems to be considerably more difficult than what we did in the previous project.

It also seems to be more grounded in actual real-life work, which is quite satisfying.
This project may prove helpful for the side project I have in mind for work.

we shall see . . . .
