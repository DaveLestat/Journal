I finally figured out my Salmon Cookies code.  I made more sense once I tried to explain it to Max.  Nevertheless, I don't see myself completely understanding the code unless I spend a good 30min reading through it again.  
The Chocolate Pizza project seems like it won't be too diffucult.  I should probaly still find a partner, as my confidence in CSS is quite lacking.
