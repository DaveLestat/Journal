The Chocolate Pizza is almost done.  While this did not feel difficult, it certainly felt a bit time consuming.  Haley was great at pointing out my sytax errors, and that helped a lot.

I am a bit concerned about about the next project, Bus-Mall.  While it sounds like it will be really fun, this next weekend will I will be drilling and also taking the advancement exam, and that doesn't leave much room for anything else. 

I kinda wished the government had shutdown. sigh
