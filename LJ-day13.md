HOLY COW!!!!  I am stressing about this project!  Work has been a bit stressful in the past week and I have been falling behind the reading submissions.  I figured that after the 'About Me' project, I would at least be able to keep up with the js code.

AU CONTRAIRE!!!!!  Creating the table "list" was quite challenging, but creating an actual table in JS fried my brain!  The functions in JS are completely of a different language than those for Calculus.  I thought I could rely on it, but I seem to have misunderstood the how math aptitude helps in coding.

I have looked at various people's code, worked with many of my other classmates and the TA's and it seems like everyone has a different way of doing things, which can make things a bit confusing.

I have managed to make the code work, but I am still having a hard time interpreting what exactly I did.  My goal before the end of this project is to not break the code and understand what every line of code does.

we shall see  . . . .
