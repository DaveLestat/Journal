Today was a drag. . . .

I took the final and despite studying . . . I made a few mistakes that drop me to a 79. That kinda ruined the entusiasm for the rest of the day. In college if you fail the final there is usually no way to pass the class. I was ready to simply quit at this point and start again at a later date. But . . . . I did try hard to catch up with all my work.

And the final project it the moment to really try out what you have learned. Might as well finish the class. It would be nice to see the result of everything we have learned.
Besides, it is fun working with these guys. I am really worried that we may be a bit over our heads, and I am really excited to see what we come up with.
