Well, today was intense.  A little bit, at least.  Trying to learn three different systems is more challenging that I would have thought, and at the same time, the concepts seem to mesh together.

During the first project, I found myself stuck in the if/else tags.

I need to figure out how to get the the code to automatcally jump from one block of code to the other instead of following the next line of code.

We shall see.
