It is official, I am quite concerned!!!!  Of all days, my laptop dies yesterday, making Tuesday a worthless day spent on trying to do all the prework on my windows compute.  My bus-mall code is far from even operational, let alone close to completion.

All that time that I spent trying to get this thing ready for work I should' have used to tweak my code.

I am stressing, and while I have other things to accomplish, I cannot seem to be able to focus on anything else.  

Well, at least I am not completely laptopless and now I can get back to working on the bus-mall code, which for some reason doesn't seem to work.

it did on Monday.  Well, debugging should come in useful.
