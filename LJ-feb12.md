Drill weekend is over, and I feel exhausted mentally.  Despite trying my best to complete the code assignment on Saturday, I did not even get to add any code.  As I started to work on it, I felt overwhelmed and my mind could not even phantom the complexity of the project at glance.

In my mind, I got as far as an array.  That's it.

Anyway, it seems that some coders can suffer from coder's block just like authors can suffer from writer's block.

On the upside, I did get a better idea of what I could do if I actually graduated in the Python stack.  My friend who works at Amazon explained it a bit more.  It seems more interesting now that before.
