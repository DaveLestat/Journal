These last two days have been intense.
I dream code, I speak code, I have converted to the Cult of the Almighty Code. 
(sigh)

After much trouble I have been able to keep up, and much of this is making sense. I now look forward to Sunday's (the only day I seem to have any free time) to keep improving my code.
The functions lab was tricky, but it seemed fairly easy at first, which is a testament to my improving.

Now I just want to catch up with all the other readings.
